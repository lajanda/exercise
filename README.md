## Exercise repository to practice contributing changes

As an example we will collaboratively develop a cookbook for taco recipes,
inspired by [tacofancy](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy).


### Our goals

- Contribute a taco recipe to this cookbook.
- [random-text.md](random-text.md) can be used to practice trivial changes (typos).


### Notes for instructors

This is a simpler version of
